# IoTSysInfo

A Universal Windows App that mimicks the *web portal* to a Windows 10 IoT device. 

About
A Windows 10 IoT device has a web portal in which you can view various aspects of the running device. You can also set some aspects. 
The readable status items are accessed via the portal gain this access through REST calls from JavaScript. 
This app uses the same APIs and accesses them through REST. 
As the responses are in JSON format, the app recursively parses the respone to generate the inormation to be displayed.

## UI Versions
There are two UI versions of this app, both using the same REST and JSON processing code. 
They differ on the UI interface in that the first version is a simple interface meant for a standard desktop screen. 
The second is more complex in that the UI is devided into three sections and are subject to State Triggers. 
This vesrion is meant for smaller screens as well as the desktop as the triggers can auotmatically hide parts of the UI which can be manually trigggered for display. Repository Versions 2.0 are all of the second UI format. See VERSIONs: belowThe Take HomeThis app shows you how you access various system attributes of a Windows 10 IoT device from a Universal Windows App running on the device or on another Windows 10 device (IoT, Phone or Desktop). It exemplifies REST calls and recursive JSON parsing.AcknowledgementThe basis of this app (wrt REST and the Web Portal API) came for a blog by Bruce Eitman: •Windows 10 IoT Core: Getting the MAC Address from Raspberry Pi.•Windows 10 IoT Core: Stop A Running Package•Windows 10 IoT Core: Shutdown and Reboot the Raspberry Pi

*Footnote:•The web portal of a Windows 10 IoT device is accessed at http://the_device_IP_address:8080eg. http://192.168.0.28:8080 whereas for other devices the port is 80.

Now inludes an ability to install packages on Win 10 IoT-Core
