# ms-iot-community-samples
An aggregatuion of of Windows 10 IoT GitHub projects as a set of md files for ms-iot Sample projects from Community. Each md points to a user's Sample project. Through project properties in the .MD files, projects so listed are searchable and sortable. Project .MD files that are reposited in this repository are integrated into the site: 

http://sportronicsiot.azurewebsites.net/  [This will be moved to http://sportronics.com.au in due course.]

https://github.com/ms-iot/Samples projects only take contributions from appropriate MS staff, although they will take bug fixes from the community. This site is meant to mirror ms-iot/Samples for community contributions.

# Contributions
To publicise your GitHub Windows IoT project create a Markdown (.MD) project using the template Template.MD. Make the filename the same as the project name. Be sure to complete the database information at the top. Your project ReadMe file with the database info at top may be enough. When you add links to the database information, they must be full paths, not relative.

You can either forward the .MD file to me via email or do a Pull Request with this repository.
